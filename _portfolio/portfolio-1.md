New Providence's public transportation system is formal yet informal. The Road Traffic Act 1967 designed a system where private jitney operators compete with each other for fares. During my undergraduate career, I relied on this system heavily. I arrived where I need to but not without the occasional safety concerns. Drawing on those experiences, I have always been interested in designing a better system. This modelling effort is an attempt to understand how the system functions. 

The goal of this model is to examine how many transfers between buses are necessary for commuters to reach their destination. This is not only a question about functionality, but one of costs as well. Because the transit system is decentralized, transfers are not free. A commuter could pay up to 5.25 — 3 transfers — to get to their destination. This has implications for those who commonly depend on this system: working class women and school children. Transfer costs aside, there are also time costs. Every transfer adds waiting time and uncertainty. Profit is a key driver of the system whereas operators are congested on certain routes. Less profitable routes are unreliable as buses are infrequent.

This model consists of commuters who have origins and destinations. In the model, commuters utilize bus routes to get to their destination. These origin-destination pairs are randomly chosen. The model is built in NetLogo using the GIS extension. I use a landcover raster of New Providence, and a vector shapefile of the island's bus routes for agents to interact with.
