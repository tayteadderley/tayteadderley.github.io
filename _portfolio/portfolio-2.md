This model attempts to advance research on climate change and sea-level rise in Caribbean coastal communities by examining how agents react given their choices and surroundings. Agent-based models in this area reveal contradictions: Bell et al. (2021) find Bangladeshi citizens continue moving to coastlines despite climate impacts, while Adams (2016) shows coastal populations cite various reasons for staying amid environmental degradation—neither aligning with "rational" expectations. Yet Milfont et al. (2021) suggest climate concern increases over time. This complexity demands further study, particularly in the Caribbean context.

This NetLogo agent-based model simulates coastal residents' responses to sea-level rise, where agents must decide whether to leave or adapt based on their wealth, employment status, and proximity to rising floodwaters. The model simulates flooding progression and tracks economic impacts through while testing scenarios with and without government assistance to offset adaptation or relocation costs.
