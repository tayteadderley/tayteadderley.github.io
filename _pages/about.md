As a 1st year PhD Student at Northeastern University in the Policy School, I am broadly interested in the feedback processes between climate change and human behavior. While climate research has extensively mapped biophysical vulnerabilities, the integration of the social dimensions to study such systems needs further focus. This gap has profound implications for both scientific models and policy design.
 
Human-environment interaction is a continuous feedback loop: societal actions reshape the environment, and these environmental changes, in turn, shape human societies. I aim to employ computational methods to uncover and model these interactions, with a focus on the micro-level behaviors and macro-level outcomes in complex systems. Specifically, I seek to understand how human responses to climatic events can reshape social structures and community resilience. The goal is to generate actionable insights that critically inform both climate research and policy, with a particular emphasis on the high-vulnerability contexts of Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC).

Being from The Bahamas, a small island developing state whose vulnerabilities to climate change are multi-dimensional, has shaped my focus. The Bahamas’ situation is characteristic of the LAC region, which is one of high vulnerability with limited capabilities for adaptation and mitigation. Advancing socially informed climate research is not only an academic pursuit but an urgent necessity for effective action in these high-risk contexts.
